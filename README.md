# Deep Learning Model Analysis for Alphabet Soup Funding

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model that predicts the success of funding applicants for Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation. The goal is to create a binary classifier that can determine whether applicants will be successful if funded, using various features from the dataset.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- **Target variable(s)**: 
  - `IS_SUCCESSFUL`

- **Feature variables**: 
  - `APPLICATION_TYPE`
  - `AFFILIATION`
  - `CLASSIFICATION`
  - `USE_CASE`
  - `ORGANIZATION`
  - `STATUS`
  - `INCOME_AMT`
  - `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`
  - `ASK_AMT`

- **Variables removed**: 
  - `EIN`
  - `NAME`

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- **Model architecture**:
  - Initial model: Two hidden layers (80 and 30 neurons)
  - Hidden layers: ReLU activation
  - Output layer: Sigmoid activation
  - This architecture was chosen as a starting point to balance complexity and performance.

- **Target model performance**:
  - Target: 75% accuracy
  - Achieved: Approximately 73% accuracy

- **Steps taken to increase model performance**:
  1. Increased neurons in hidden layers (80, 30, 15)
  2. Added an additional hidden layer
  3. Increased epochs from 50 to 100
  4. Further adjusted neurons in hidden layers (120, 50, 1)

## Summary

The deep learning model achieved an accuracy of around 73%, falling short of the 75% target. Despite multiple optimization attempts, significant improvement was not observed.

### Recommendation

To potentially improve performance, a Random Forest Classifier is recommended for the following reasons:

1. Handles non-linear relationships well
2. Less prone to overfitting
3. Provides feature importance
4. Often performs well on tabular data without extensive preprocessing

**Implementation example**:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming X contains features and y contains the target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Random Forest Accuracy: {accuracy}")
